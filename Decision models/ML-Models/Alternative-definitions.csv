t-SNE,t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces while preserving local and global structure.
UMAP,"UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique similar to t-SNE but more scalable, which preserves both local and global structure of data."
Noise Contrastive Priors (NCP),Noise Contrastive Priors is a method used for training generative models by contrasting the model's predictions with noisy versions of the data.
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA),"CCA is a multivariate statistical technique used to analyze the correlation between two sets of variables, aiming to find linear combinations that maximize the correlation."
Mixture of Experts,"Mixture of Experts is an ensemble method where multiple models, known as experts, are combined using a gating network to handle different regions of the input space effectively."
Voting,"Voting is an ensemble method where multiple models make predictions, and the final prediction is determined by aggregating the individual predictions through a voting mechanism."
Majority Voting,Majority Voting is a simple ensemble method where the final prediction is determined by selecting the class predicted by the majority of base models.
